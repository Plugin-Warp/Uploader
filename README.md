# WarpLoad

WarpLoad is a web-based tool that allows extension developers to upload their WarpCore extensions to Impact. It provides an easy way to upload `.js` files directly to the extensions folder of the repository using a Access Token.

## Features

- Simple web interface for uploading JavaScript files
- Requires Access Token for authentication
- Automatically commits files to the extensions folder
- Supports overwriting existing files
- Secure file upload process

## How to Use

1. Open the **WarpLoad** web page.
2. Select your JavaScript extension file (`.js`).
3. Enter your **Access Token**.
4. Click **Upload**.
5. Your extension will be uploaded to the Impact repository.

## Notes

- File names should be unique to prevent unintended overwrites.
- The repository maintainers may review uploaded extensions.
